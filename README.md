# Fruit-Fly-Behaviour
A research project done at the University of Ottawa to study the resting and eating behaviour of fed and starved fruit flies in a closed lab settting.

Once data was collected at a lab, it was separated into intervals of either eating or resting state. After cleaning and preparing the data, R was used for data visualization and analysis. Read the file 'key' for details on the objective, assumptions and method of the analysis.
