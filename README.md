# Fruit-Fly-Behaviour: Boxplots and ANOVA 
A research project done at the University of Ottawa to study the resting and eating behaviour of fed and starved fruit flies in a closed lab settting.

Once data was collected at a lab, it was separated into intervals of either eating or resting state. After cleaning and preparing the data, R was used for data visualization and analysis. Read 'key.pdf' for details on the objective, assumptions and method of the analysis; read 'prepare_data.R' for the script to clean and format the data for analysis; read 'visualize_data.R' to transform data into boxplots; read 'analyze_data.R' to statistically analyze the results and to test the assumptions associated with the analysis.
