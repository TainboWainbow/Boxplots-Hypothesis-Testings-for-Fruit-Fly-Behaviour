# Objective
By analyzing the data, we would like to study the feeding behaviour of the starved and fed flies, and their differences.

# Definitions
Feeding period: the fly stays on the sensing pad, where it drinks the sugar water, for at least 5 seconds
Resting period: the fly stays off the sensing pad for at least 10 seconds
Data is categorized as either feeding(1) or resting(0) period; there is only two categories (0, 1).

# Assumptions
Since the sensitivy of the pad may not be accurate at times, we make the following assumptions for the cases:
- If there is a break of less than 10 seconds in between two feeding periods, then the three periods altogether are considered as one feeding period.
- If there is a break of 10 seconds or more in between two feeding periods, then we have a feeding, a resting and then a feeding period.

The same assumption applies to the time on the sensing pad in between resting periods:
- If the fly is on the pad for less than 5 seconds in between resting periods, then the three periods altogether are considered as one resting period.
- If thhe fly is on the pad for 5 seconds or more in between resting periods, then we have a resting, feeding and then a resting period. 

# Data collection
For each collection of data, one fly is placed in a container with the sensing pad on which there is a small well of glucose water.
Once the fly is released in the container, the data is collected for the next one hour. 

# Method of Analysis
Boxplots were created for each feeding and period period and for fed and starved flies to compare the lengths of time.
Then, a cumulative frequency graph was produced for each fed and starved flies to study the feeding havriour.
